# Oak Block → Crafting Table → 4 Planks → Inventory

## User Instruction

try to drag an oak block into the crafting area. ensure you get 4 planks and can drag them to the inventory

## Target

- Scope: unstaged
- Display name: unstaged changes on unknown
- Current branch: unknown
- Main branch: unknown

## Cookie Sync

- Required: No
- Reason: This is a brand-new local demo app with no authentication, no user accounts, and no server-side session. All state appears to be client-side UI within CraftingTable.tsx. No cookies are needed to execute the flow.
- Enabled for this saved flow: No

## Target URLs

- http://localhost:3000

## Risk Areas

- CraftingTable.tsx — drag-and-drop event handlers (onDragStart, onDrop, onDragOver) may not be wired correctly for all grid cells.
- CraftingTable.tsx — recipe resolution logic: oak log placed in any cell should yield exactly 4 oak planks.
- CraftingTable.tsx — output slot interaction: dragging result to inventory must clear the output slot and deduct the input.
- src/app/globals.css / Tailwind (postcss.config.mjs) — layout or z-index issues could block drop targets.
- public/textures/ — missing or mis-referenced texture paths (oak_planks.png, oak_log_side.png) could indicate broken asset pipeline.
- next.config.ts — any image domain or asset prefix misconfiguration could break texture rendering.
- src/app/page.tsx — if the inventory panel and crafting table are not both mounted, drag source or drop target may be absent.

## Assumptions

- The Next.js dev server is running (e.g. `npm run dev`) and accessible at http://localhost:3000.
- The crafting UI is rendered on the root page (src/app/page.tsx imports CraftingTable).
- An oak log / oak block item is available in an inventory or item panel on the page that can be dragged.
- The crafting recipe for 1 oak log → 4 oak planks is implemented in CraftingTable.tsx.
- Drag-and-drop is implemented via native HTML5 drag events or a JS drag library (exact API unknown until runtime).
- No authentication or account state is required — this is a local demo app with no login flow.

## Steps

### 1. Load the app and confirm crafting UI is visible

Instruction: Navigate to http://localhost:3000. Wait for the page to fully load. Verify that the crafting table component is rendered — look for a 3×3 crafting grid and an output slot.
Expected outcome: The page displays a Minecraft-style crafting table UI with a 3×3 input grid, an output slot, and an inventory or item panel containing at least one oak log/block item. Textures (crafting_gui.png) are loaded without broken-image icons.

### 2. Locate the oak log item in the inventory/item panel

Instruction: Scan the inventory panel or item bar for an oak log item (it should display the oak_log_side.png or oak_log_top.png texture). Hover over it to confirm its tooltip or label reads 'Oak Log' or 'Oak Block'.
Expected outcome: An oak log item is clearly visible and identifiable in the source inventory area. Tooltip or label confirms it is the correct item.
Route hint: /
Changed file evidence: src/components/CraftingTable.tsx, public/textures/oak_log_side.png, public/textures/oak_log_top.png

### 3. Drag the oak log into the crafting grid

Instruction: Click and hold the oak log item, then drag it onto any cell in the 3×3 crafting grid and release (drop). If the UI uses click-to-pick-up and click-to-place, click the oak log first, then click a crafting grid cell.
Expected outcome: The oak log appears inside the targeted crafting grid cell. The cell visually updates to show the oak log texture. No error or console warning about an invalid drop target.
Route hint: /
Changed file evidence: src/components/CraftingTable.tsx

### 4. Verify the output slot shows 4 oak planks

Instruction: After placing the oak log in the crafting grid, inspect the output slot (arrow → result area). Confirm it displays an oak planks item with a stack count of 4.
Expected outcome: The output slot renders the oak_planks.png texture with a '4' quantity indicator. This confirms the recipe logic (1 oak log → 4 planks) is correctly implemented.
Route hint: /
Changed file evidence: src/components/CraftingTable.tsx, public/textures/oak_planks.png, public/textures/oak_planks_flat.png

### 5. Drag the 4 oak planks from the output slot to the inventory

Instruction: Click and hold (or click-to-pick-up) the oak planks stack in the output slot. Drag it to an empty slot in the inventory panel and release/drop.
Expected outcome: The 4 oak planks move into the inventory slot. The output slot becomes empty. The crafting grid input cell also clears (oak log is consumed). The inventory slot now shows 4 oak planks.
Route hint: /
Changed file evidence: src/components/CraftingTable.tsx

### 6. Confirm crafting grid and output slot are cleared

Instruction: After the transfer, visually inspect the crafting grid and output slot. All 9 grid cells and the output slot should be empty.
Expected outcome: The crafting grid is fully empty and the output slot shows no item. This validates that item consumption and state reset logic in CraftingTable.tsx work correctly.
Route hint: /
Changed file evidence: src/components/CraftingTable.tsx

### 7. Verify inventory correctly holds the 4 planks

Instruction: Hover over or inspect the inventory slot that received the oak planks. Confirm the item label/tooltip says 'Oak Planks' and the count is 4.
Expected outcome: Inventory slot shows oak_planks texture with count 4 and correct label. No visual glitches or texture-loading errors in the inventory area.
Route hint: /
